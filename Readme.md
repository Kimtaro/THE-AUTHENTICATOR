THE AUTHENTICATOR
===================

THE AUTHENTICATOR DOES NOT CARE LETTER BEFORE AUTH. THE AUTHENTICATOR PROVIDE GOOD USER EXPERIENCE. THE AUTHENTICATOR BEND OAUTH TO WILL.

What is this?
-------------

This is a proof of concept Objective-C OAuth desktop client for Twitter that implements a login flow that mimics xAuth (Username + Password).

Why?
----

Because there's been hubbubb over the bad user experience associated with OAuth. This recurfaced recently when Twitter decided that all API clients except their own must use OAuth for authentication.

How?
----

The client embeds a WebKit view to do the authentication, but restyles Twitter's normal authentication dialog to look more like a native OS X window.

Practical?
----------

It's a giant hack, and probably violates some Term of Service clause. But it works.
